# Open Science in the Pharmaceutical Industry: Analysis and Recommendations

Have you ever wondered why newly developed drugs are often so expensive? While in my master's degree, I researched the link between high drug prices and the tendency of pharma companies to keep their data proprietary.

I have long been fascinated by the pharmaceutical industry for their break-through innovations and have often heard criticisms about Big Pharma for their secrecy and high prices. I feel this project helped me become more informed of the intricacies of the data governance practices in the industry. Many players in Pharma in fact acknowledge that public distrust and affordability are pressing issues, but more can be done by the companies themselves and regulators to address these.

Special thanks to [Joana Osorio from Open Pharma](https://www.openpharma.blog/about-us/) and [Stephan Guttinger](https://www.guttinger.co.uk/) for their assistance with this project.

# Abstract
*The problems of expensive drug discovery costs, high drug prices, and public distrust are well documented in the pharmaceutical industry. Open science, or the practice of openly disclosing research methods and data, has been proposed as a solution for these ills. M4K Pharma is studied in this paper as an example of a company that has incorporated open science principles into its business model. The impact of the potential growth of similar open science businesses is explored and recommendations are presented for the role of open science in the pharmaceutical industry.*
